Pedogenic carbonates underly dryland soils and provide essential ground-level perspectives on climate change through geologic time and in the present. However, pedogenic carbonates currently fall short as tracers of water and carbon fluxes because we have an incomplete understanding of how they form.\nTo address the gap in our understanding of how soil carbonates form, my collaborator Naomi Levin and I are using triple oxygen isotope geochemistry (primer here) to directly assess the importance of evaporation during soil carbonate formation. We\u0026rsquo;re considering how and where biotic processes (root water uptake/transpiration) vs abiotic processes (evaporation) dominate soil carbonate formation.\nWe are working across aridity gradients in North America, specifically targeting two sites that are a part of the Drylands Critical Zone Network - Jornada, New Mexico, and Reynolds Creek, Idaho. Our driest soils sites are in the Mojave National Preserve which has an incredible network of above- and below- ground monitoring sites set up by our collaborator Ron Amundson (UC Berkeley).\n  Study sites take advantage of the natural gradient in aridity in the Western US.

In particular, their oxygen isotope composition ($\\delta$18O) is used to reconstruct the $\\delta$18O of ancient meteoric waters.\nThe problem: To what extent is the $\\delta$18O of soil water (and resulting soil carbonate) modified by evaporation? If soil carbonates form during evaporative dewatering, it is likely that their parent water $\\delta$18O is modified by evaporation. If unrecognized, this could lead to erroneously high estimates of $\\delta$18O of ancient precipitation. On the other hand, if soil carbonates form as a result of rootwater uptake and/or respiration-induced changes in soil CO2, the parent water $\\delta$18O might be a faithful recorder of $\\delta$18O of meteoric waters.\nWhat we are doing: We are measuring the triple oxygen isotope composition of modern soil carbonates from various environments. Evaporation will cause a deviation from the expected relationship between $\\delta$17O and $\\delta$18O in water and resulting carbonate (Figure 1) (Landais et al., 2006; Luz and Barkan, 2010; Passey et al., 2014; Gázquez et al., 2018; Surma et al., 2018; Passey and Levin, in review). Thus the ∆’17O composition of soil carbonates should indicate the extent to which their parent soil waters were evaporated (Primer on Triple Oxygen Isotopes here).\n   Figure 1: Schematic of relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O (left panel) and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and ∆\u0026rsquo;17O (right panel). ∆\u0026rsquo;17O is insensitive to the $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O of the carbonate parent water. Evaporated waters will have low ∆\u0026rsquo;17O values relative to their parent waters.    Triple Oxygen Isotope Results Preliminary results: Soil carbonate ∆’17O ranges from approximately -170 to -110 per meg, which corresponds with parent waters that range from -35 to + 25 per meg (Methods below) (Figure 2). These values are generally lower than unevaporated meteoric waters (i.e., rain and rivers), and at the lowest, resemble evaporated meteoric waters (i.e., closed basin lakes). Thus far, a complicated relationship between aridity and ∆’17O of soil carbonates is emerging. We speculate that there might be the hint of some kind of “threshold aridity.” Below such a threshold aridity (more arid) we observe a spread in ∆’17O. Above such a threshold (less arid) we observe relatively high ∆’17O values of soil waters (less evaporation). This pattern might indicate that soil carbonates form during evaporation in the most arid environments (aridity index, AI, \u0026lt; 0.2). In semi-arid to humid environments (AI \u0026gt; 0.2), soil carbonate forms via other processes and/or soil waters are regularly recharged with non-evaporated waters. In such an environment, $\\delta$18O of soil carbonates might be more reliable recorders of rainfall $\\delta$18O.\n   Figure 2: Reconstructed soil water ∆’17O (black dots) and ∆’17O of meteoric waters (Aron et al., Chem Geo, in prep) (colored dots). Reconstructed soil water ∆’17O values are low compared to most meteoric waters; we interpret this pattern as indicating that many soil waters overprinted by some amount of evaporation.      Figure 3: Calculated ∆’17O of soil waters reconstructed from soil carbonates. Aridity index (AI) is calculated as the mean annual precipitation (MAP) divided by potential evapotranspiration (PET) using WorldClim data (Beverly et al., 2019; Fick and Hijmans 2017). The black outline indicates data that is newly presented in this work (measurements made at the University of Michigan). The data from Texas, USA are from Ji (2016); all other data are from Passey et al. (2014).   \nBonus: Modeling of Triple Oxygen Isotopes in a Soil Profile Evaporation only: We’ve started to model ∆’17O in a soil profile using the TOUGHREACT numerical simulation program. Below, we have plotted monthly time steps for a 1-D soil profile undergoing one year of evaporation (Figure 4). The model is isothermal, atmospheric relative humidity is set to 40 %, and the model does not incorporate transpiration. The year of evaporation results in an enormous ∆’17O-soil water excursion – up to -100 per meg lower than starting ∆’17O (0 per meg) [see also the similar theoretical profile of Barnes and Allison (1983)]. Because a year of uninterrupted evaporation would only occur in the driest locations on earth (e.g., the non-vegetated Atacama Desert), this scenario shows the maximum potential effect of evaporation on ∆’17O-soil water and therefore ∆’17O-soil carbonate.\n   Figure 4: Modeling D’17O of a soil profile. One year of evaporation (isothermal soil profile).   A little more realistic: To give a sense of the range of ∆’17O-soil water in a more realistic scenario, we modeled the Adams Ranch Soil Climate Analysis Network site in central New Mexico, a semi-arid environment (mean annual precipitation of 230 mm/yr) where soil carbonate readily forms. As above, we modeled an isothermal, non-vegetated system (soil temperature = 15 °C, atmospheric relative humidity = 44 %). Figure 5 below shows the evolution of soil water ∆’17O after the largest rain event on record (initial value of +35 per meg) from 2011–2015, ending just before the next rain event (Figure 5). The results suggest that ∆’17O excursions of up to 20-25 per meg are possible from evaporation alone, although after most rain events ∆’17O-soil water only changes by 10-15 per meg before the next infiltration event.\n   Figure 5: Time steps of ∆’17O-soil water after the September 10, 2013 rain event at Adam’s Ranch, New Mexico. The ∆’17O of soil water resets to the rainfall value (+35 per meg) after a storm, then evolves to lower ∆’17O with drying; the plot stops at 35 days, just before the next rain event. Soil profile is held at 15 °C, atmosphere at 12.5 °C.   \nConclusions Implications for paleoclimate reconstructions:\n ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil carbonates can identify if parent soil waters have been evaporated. This will help workers evaluate the fidelity of their record for reconstructing $\\delta$18O of meteoric waters. ∆\u0026rsquo;17O promises to shed light on soil carbonate formation processes, with implications on how to interpret other stable isotope data from this widely used material. Preliminary data suggests that ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil carbonates relates to local aridity. More data will be required to establish this measurement as a true proxy for aridity.  Future work:\n Firstly, we need to finish the replicate analyses that were aborted when the University of Michigan shut down to slow the spread of Sars-Cov-2. We’re also interested in adding to our soil carbonate collection. We plan to explore other environmental factors (i.e., external constraints on timing of carbonate formation, seasonality of precipitation, vegetation type, etc.) that might also explain the ∆’17O variation that we observe. Observations of local meteoric water ∆\u0026rsquo;17O would give context to our reconstructed soil water values. We are just starting numerical modeling of ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil waters (link to bonus figures below) Future, future work: measurements of ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil water made through a seasonal cycle would be very useful.   Do you have samples to contribute? We are still expanding our collection of soil carbonate samples to include in this study. We are most interested in soil carbonate samples that already have some kind of environmental or isotope context (i.e., stable and/or clumped isotope data, water isotope data, vegetation information, etc.). If you have samples from anywhere in the world that you’d like to share with us, please get in touch!\nAcknowledgements This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1854873 to JRK.

We are using the acid digestion/reduction/fluorination method described in Passey et al. (2014). Multiple analyses of VSMOW2 and SLAP2 are performed during each analytical session and form the basis for normalization to the VSMOW-SLAP reference frame (Schoenemann et al., 2013). International carbonate standards (NBS-18, NBS-19, IAEA 603) are analyzed along with unknowns, and an internal carbonate standard (102-GC-AZ01) is used to correct for systematic drift in ∆’17O that is observed in some analytical sessions. The data shown in this presentation were analyzed in two analytical sessions (as established by CoF3 reactors number 13 and 14 at IPL). These sessions spanned from December 2019 to March 2020.\n Where shown, ∆’17O of soil waters is reconstructed from the soil carbonates using the ∆’17O of soil carbonate, an estimate of growth temperature from clumped isotopes (∆47) and a combined mineral-water and acid fractionation factor of $\\theta$a-c-w = 0.5242 (Passey et al., 2014). The 18$\\alpha$a-c-w is calculated using the equation from Kim and O\u0026rsquo;Neil (1997) and multiplied by an acid fractionation factor of 1.0081 for acid digestion of calcite at 90 °C (Kim et al., 2007):\n18\u0026frasl;16$\\alpha$a-c-w = 1.0081*$e^{((18030/(T)-32.42)/1000)}$\n$\\theta$a-c-w = ln(17\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-c-w)/ln(18\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-c-w)\nwhere T is carbonate growth temperature in Kelvin.\n Error bars in ∆’17O are 1 standard error, which is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of 0.018 (long-term SD of an internal carbonate standard, 102-GC-AZ01) by the square root of the number of replicate analyses.\n  References Aron, P.G., Levin, N.E., Beverly, E.J., Huth, T.E., Passey, B.H., Pelletier, E.M., Poulsen, C.J., Winkelstern, I.Z., Yarian, D.A.

A measurement of the abundance of 18O is widely used in geochemistry ($\\delta$18O) as a tracer for hydrologic processes. It was long assumed that stuyding 17O would not yield additional useful information because the fractionation would be about half that of 18O, following a relationship that is predicted by mass-dependent (equilibrium) fractionation ($\\theta$ = 0.529 for equilibrium fractionation, Luz and Barkan 2010):\n  Figure 1: Predicted relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O given equilibrium fractionation. $\\theta$a-b = ln(17\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-b)/ln(18\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-b), where $\\alpha$a-b is the fractionation factor between two phases (like calcite-water).   Note that the axes of Figure 1 use “delta-prime” notation, a slight variation on the more familiar delta notation. This notation is used to remove the slight curvature in the relationship between $\\delta$18O and $\\delta$17O (Miller, 2002):\n$\\delta$’x = ln($\\delta$x+1)\n$\\delta$17O can deviate from this relationship if non-equilibrium fractionation occurs (i.e., $\\theta$ ≠ 0.529). Evaporation is an example of one such fractionation process that carries $\\theta$ = 0.5185 (Barkan and Luz, 2007). Yes, 0.5185 might seem about the same as .529, but with sufficiently high precision instruments this deviation can be measured. This deviation from the expected relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O is called ∆’17O, (analogous to the familiar d-excess), and is defined as:\n$\\Delta$’17O = $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O – $\\lambda$ * $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O\n  Figure 2: Schematic of $\\Delta$\u0026rsquo;17O   Note that I\u0026rsquo;ve used $\\lambda$ = 0.528, which is the empirically observed relationship in meteoric waters (Luz and Barkan 2010). The $\\lambda$ notation expresses that it is an empirical relationship that may combine a number of different fractionations, as opposed to the $\\theta$ used above that describes a single, well-defined fractionation (like the equilibrium fractionation, diffusion, or acid fractionation). ∆’17O is expressed in permille (with values that ranges from +0.10 to -0.2), or in per meg (with values that range from +100 to -200).\nThus, $\\Delta$’17O can be used to identify evaporation of parent waters and carbonate minerals. Measuring $\\Delta$’17O promises to be useful in terrestrial hydroclimate where d18O alone can be ambiguous. Let’s consider the water bottle of Seattle tap water ($\\delta$18O = -10 ‰) that I accidentally brought with me when I moved to in Michigan last fall. If I let this water bottle sit with a lid off, it would evaporate and eventually reach a $\\delta$18O= -6 ‰. At that point, it would be impossible to distinguish my imported Seattle water from that of local Ann Arbor tap water using $\\delta$18O analyses. $\\Delta$’17O could be used to readily identify which water was evaporated; the Seattle water would have a $\\Delta$’17O value that is about 0.10 ‰ lower than that of the Michigan water (evaporation experiments in Li et al., 2017).\n$\\Delta$’17O has the potential to be useful in addition to the more familiar d-excess for two reasons. The first is the fractionation in oxygen isotopes is not very sensitive to temperature (i.e., Angert et al., 2004). The second is that carbonate minerals are widely preserved in the geologic record, where it is difficult to find co-occurring preservation of hydrogen and oxygen that would be necessary to calculate d-excess. Furthermore, the growth temperature can be directly measured from the same carbonate mineral (using clumps), allowing for a simultaneous estimate of environmental temperature and hydrologic processes.\n  Figure 3: Schematic of $\\Delta$\u0026rsquo;17O vs $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O in waters   In studies of paleo-hydroclimate, we could use ∆’17O to parse out if changes in $\\delta$18O were due to Rayleigh distillation (i.e., rainout over a mountain range) or due to evaporation. Other processes that cause kinetic fractionation could also be investigated (i.e., speleothems, as predicted in Guo and Zhou, 2019). Note that ∆’17O should be independent of the starting $\\delta$18O composition. It might even be possible to use the ∆’17O of carbonates to reconstruct the $\\delta$18O of primary meteoric waters (i.e., lake carbonates in Passey and Ji, 2019).\nMeasuring ∆’17O in carbonate materials posed a technical challenge to isotope geochemists. Usually the isotopic composition of a carbonate mineral is determined by first digesting the CaCO3 in phosphoric acid, then measuring the isotope abundances in the evolved CO2 gas. However, 13C-16O-16O interferes with the measurement of 12C-17O-16O. So, CO2 gas evolved from solid CaCO3 needs to be converted to O2 for measurement. Passey et al. (2014) describe the acid digestion, reduction, and fluorination method which is currently in place at the University of Michigan.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"d49c532573dbaf14074a1c5641671dd5","permalink":"/primer/tripleoprimer/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/primer/tripleoprimer/","section":"primer","summary":"What are all those primes for anyway?","tags":["project","methods","triple oxygen isotopes"],"title":"Triple Oxygen Isotopes","type":"primer"},{"authors":["JR Kelson","KW Huntington","DO Breecker","LK Burgener","TM Gallagher","GD Hoke","SV Petersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"00b5b941f585392390bbc57e444428a3","permalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Soil carbonates are important paleoclimate archives, but interpretations of their isotopic compositions (ẟ18O, ẟ13C, and ∆47) are hampered by uncertainty in the annual timing of their accumulation. Several previous studies have inferred the annual timing of soil carbonate formation by comparing modern air/soil temperatures with temperatures estimated from the clumped isotopic composition (T∆47) of Holocene soil carbonates. Here, we compile the existing ∆47 data to first consider if recent changes in ∆47 standardization methods alters the apparent seasonal biases. Then we explore the importance of various environmental parameters on soil carbonate T∆47 and discuss implications for associated paleoclimate reconstructions. Most soil carbonates record T∆47 values higher than mean annual air temperature, but the residual varies from -4 to +24 °C. ∆47 values for most observed soil profiles do not vary with depth. We find that the grain size of the soil matrix, timing of precipitation, and presence of vegetation each explain a portion of the observed variance in seasonal bias and can be used to aid in interpretations of T∆47 values from paleosols. In some soil carbonates, a warm-season bias in T∆47 is accompanied with calculated ẟ18O values of soil water that appear to be biased toward the ẟ18O of summer rainfall. Most estimated values of ẟ18O of soil water are within 2 ‰ of the ẟ18O values of mean annual rainfall.  Where possible, paleoclimate reconstructions should consider precipitation timing, soil texture, and vegetation cover to aid in identifying the seasonal bias of soil carbonate stable isotopic compositions.","tags":["clumped isotopes","soil carbonates"],"title":"A proxy for all seasons?

The absolute abundance of heavy isotopes in the universal standards VPDB and VSMOW (defined by four parameters: R13VPDB, R17VSMOW, R18VSMOW, and λ) impact calculated Δ47 values. Here, we investigate whether use of updated and more accurate values for these parameters can remove observed interlaboratory differences in the measured T‐Δ47 relationship. Using the updated parameters, we reprocess 14 published calibration data sets measured in 11 different laboratories, representing many mineralogies, bulk compositions, sample types, reaction temperatures, and sample preparation and analysis methods. Exploiting this large composite data set (n = 1,253 sample replicates), we investigate the possibility for a “universal” clumped isotope calibration. We find that applying updated parameters improves the T‐Δ47 relationship (reduces residuals) within most labs and improves overall agreement but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We reaffirm earlier findings that different mineralogies do not require different calibration equations and that cleaning procedures, method of pressure baseline correction, and mass spectrometer type do not affect interlaboratory agreement. We also present new estimates of the temperature dependence of the acid digestion fractionation for Δ47 (Δ*25‐X), based on combining reprocessed data from four studies, and new theoretical equilibrium values to be used in calculation of the empirical transfer function. Overall, we have ruled out a number of possible causes of interlaboratory disagreement in the T‐Δ47 relationship, but many more remain to be investigated.","tags":["clumped isotopes","calibrations","methods development"],"title":"Effects of Improved 17O Correction on Interlaboratory Agreement in Clumped Isotope Calibrations, Estimates of Mineral‐Specific Offsets, and Temperature Dependence of Acid Digestion Fractionation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nicole culminated her 2 years of undergraduate research with a presentation at the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium.

Upper Cretaceous terrestrial climate proxies have been interpreted as evidence for “equable” climates with reduced seasonal variations in temperature. However, climate models have largely failed to reproduce these reconstructions unless parameters such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations are set to unreasonable values. To help resolve such model-proxy disagreements, we reconstruct mean annual range in temperature (MART) for the Campanian (~75 Ma) Kaiparowits (south-central Utah) and Two Medicine (northwest Montana) Formations using warmest mean monthly temperature reconstructions from the clumped isotope composition of paleosol carbonate nodules, and reconstructions of local mean annual air temperatures from other methods. An evaluation of the applicability of bulk elemental soil geochemistry temperature proxies in these deposits supports the use of previous leaf physiognomy-based estimates of mean annual temperature for our MART reconstructions. We test the validity of several common assumptions made in reconstructing MART in two novel ways. First, MART is commonly calculated as twice the difference between local mean annual air temperature and warmest mean monthly temperature, and we validate this method by estimating modern MART for a range of environments using climate reanalysis data. Second, we constrain the effect of radiative soil heating on our soil carbonate temperature estimates by showing that for most environments likely to be preserved in the geologic record, summer soil temperatures are 9 °C) larger than previous proxy reconstructions of Late Cretaceous MART. These results add to a growing body of literature showing that terrestrial MART during ancient greenhouse periods was not significantly different from modern seasonal temperature variations. Finally, the similarity in MART between the Kaiparowits and Two Medicine formations suggests that latitudinal changes in MART did not contribute to the faunal provincialism that has been proposed by some paleontologists.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Revisiting the equable climate problem during the Late Cretaceous greenhouse using paleosol carbonate clumped isotope temperatures from the Campanian of the Western Interior Basin, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Kelson","D Watford","C Bataille","KW Huntington","E Hyland","GJ Bowen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539216000,"objectID":"30a720329b9322be4d72e0af7f3c473c","permalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Records of subtropical climate on land from the early Paleogene offer insights into how the Earth system responds to greenhouse climate conditions. Fluvial and floodplain deposits of the Tornillo Basin (Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA) preserve a record of environmental and climatic change of the Paleocene and the early Eocene. We report carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotopic compositions (δ13C, δ18O, and Δ47) of paleosol carbonate nodules from this basin. Mineralogical, geochemical, and thermal modeling evidence suggests that the measured isotopic values preserve primary environmental signals with a summer bias with the exception of data from two nodules reset by local igneous intrusions. The unaltered nodules record Δ47 temperatures of 25 ± 4 and 32 ± 2 °C for the Paleocene and early Eocene nodules, respectively, showing an increase in average summer temperatures of 7 ± 3 °C. Calculations of δ18O of soil water are −2.8 ± 0.7‰ and −0.8 ± 0.4‰ (standard mean ocean water) for the early‐mid‐Paleocene and late Paleocene‐early Eocene, showing an increase of 2.0 ± 0.9‰. The increase in temperature and δ18O values likely relates to a rise in atmospheric pCO2, although we cannot rule out that changes in paleosol texture and regional precipitation patterns also influence the record. Comparison with Δ47 estimates of summer temperature from the Green River and Bighorn Basins (WY) highlights that terrestrial surface temperatures are heterogeneous, and latitudinal temperature gradients on land remain undetermined. Previously published paleoclimate models predict summer temperatures that are 2 to 6 °C higher than our estimate; discrepancies between climate models and proxy data persist at lower latitudes.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Warm Terrestrial Subtropics During the Paleocene and Eocene: Carbonate Clumped Isotope (Δ47) Evidence From the Tornillo Basin, Texas (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537538400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537538400,"objectID":"dc9017504b3be6a9e93c84f297d22142","permalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","publishdate":"2018-11-12T10:23:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates"],"title":"Carbonate Clumped Isotopes: Certainties and Uncertainties of Thermometry and Eocene Subtropical Paleoclimate","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"When do soil carbonates form?

In the CO2 molecule above, there are heavy isotopes (18O and 13C) bonded together. (FYI, their common/light counterparts are 12C and 16O). This makes for a molecule with an atomic mass of 47, hence the common ∆47 notation for \u0026lsquo;clumped isotopes\u0026rsquo;. Conveniently for paleoclimatologist, the rare/heavy isotopes preferentially clump at lower temperatures.\n  But how does this work? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a balloon full of CO2 gas with a fixed number of light and heavy isotopes each. In a balloon held at 1000 °C, the system is chaotic. Bonds are vibrating and wiggling and nothing really settles down. In this high-temperature system, the heavy and light isotopes end up being randomly distributed amongst the molecules.\n  Only one clumpy molecule in the hot balloon. Heavy isotopes are dark colors, light isotopes are light colors.   In a balloon held at lower temperatures (\u0026lt;1000 °C), the system can reach a more energetically favorable state. Clumping heavy isotopes together is favorable because it slightly reduces the vibrational energy and increases bond strength. So more clumps will occur at lower temperatures.\n  Three clumpy molecules in the cold balloon. Note same number of heavy isotopes.   Thus, clumped isotope geochemistry is not concerned with the total number of heavy isotopes in a system, but rather how those heavy isotopes are arranged within the molecules. We do need to know the number of heavy isotopes in the system, though, so we can calculate how many clumps we would expect if they were randomly arranged vs. how many we actually have measured. Then, we can estimate the temperature at which that CO2 molecule formed!\nUsually, what is measured is the clumpiness of CO2 gas that we get by digesting a carbonate mineral in acid. Common targets are soil carbonates and shells. With a little bit more work (see other projects), we can use the clumpiness we measure to estimate temperatures at or near the surface of the Earth millions of years ago. This thermometer is not based on biology nor does it depend on the isotopic composition of the water from which the mineral grew.

These 17O correction parameters are required to calculate ∆47 when measured with mass spectrometry (i.e., in all labs making clumped isotope measurements). As a result of this effort, all clumped labs are now using a set of correction parameters recommended by IUPAC (presented in Brand et al., 2010), rather than the parameters from Santrock et al.

The most commonly suggested causes of these discrepancies are the method of mineral precipitation and analytical differences, including the temperature of phosphoric acid used to digest carbonates. However, these mechanisms have yet to be tested in a consistent analytical setting, which makes it difficult to isolate the cause(s) of discrepancies and to evaluate which synthetic calibration is most appropriate for natural samples. Here, we systematically explore the impact of synthetic carbonate precipitation by replicating precipitation experiments of previous workers under a constant analytical setting. We (1) precipitate 56 synthetic carbonates at temperatures of 4–85 °C using different procedures to degas CO2, with and without the use of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to promote rapid dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) equilibration; (2) digest samples in phosphoric acid at both 90 °C and 25 °C; and (3) hold constant all analytical methods including acid preparation, CO2 purification, and mass spectrometry; and (4) reduce our data with 17O corrections that are appropriate for our samples. We find that the CO2 degassing method does not influence Δ47 values of these synthetic carbonates, and therefore probably only influences natural samples with very rapid degassing rates, like speleothems that precipitate out of drip solution with high pCO2. CA in solution does not influence Δ47 values in this work, suggesting that disequilibrium in the DIC pool is negligible. We also find the Δ47 values of samples reacted in 25 and 90 °C acid are within error of each other (once corrected with a constant acid fractionation factor). Taken together, our results show that the Δ47-temperature relationship does not measurably change with either the precipitation methods used in this study or acid digestion temperature. This leaves phosphoric acid preparation, CO2 gas purification, and/or data reduction methods as the possible sources of the discrepancy among published calibrations. In particular, the use of appropriate 17O corrections has the potential to reduce disagreement among calibrations. Our study nearly doubles the available synthetic carbonate calibration data for Δ47 thermometry (adding 56 samples to the 74 previously published samples). This large population size creates a robust calibration that enables us to examine the potential for calibration slope aliasing due to small sample size. The similarity of Δ47 values among carbonates precipitated under such diverse conditions suggests that many natural samples grown at 4–85 °C in moderate pH conditions (6–10) may also be described by our Δ47-temperature relationship.","tags":["clumped isotopes","calibrations","methods development"],"title":"Toward a universal carbonate clumped isotope calibration: Diverse synthesis and preparatory methods suggest a single temperature relationship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AJ Schauer","JR Kelson","C Saenger","KW Huntington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474416000,"objectID":"353bccfa5a7162dac9044e05d76e75a0","permalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Rationale: The clumped isotope composition of CO2 (Δ47) derived from carbonate is widely used as a paleotemperature proxy with broad applications in geoscience. Its accuracy is, however, limited by inter‐laboratory discrepancies of reference materials and disagreement among carbonate geothermometer calibrations. Here we show how the correction for the abundance of 17O influences these discrepancies. Methods:We used CO2‐H2O equilibration at known temperatures and phosphoric acid digested carbonates to generate CO2 samples with a wide range in 13C and 18O compositions. All samples were purified using an offline vacuum line. We used a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Faraday collector array for m/z 44–49, to measure δ13C, δ18O, δ47, and Δ47 values. Data were compiled using a traditional correction (‘Santrock’) for the 17O interference in m/z 45 as well as a more recently proposed correction (‘Brand’) for 17O interference. Two reference frames using CO2 with distinct 13C compositions were constructed to simulate an inter‐laboratory comparison. Results: The traditional Santrock 17O correction leads to a simulated Δ47 inter‐laboratory comparison offset of 0.06 ‰, and a 0.1 ‰ Δ47 range in CO2‐H2O 23°C equilibrations that is dependent on the 13C composition. The more recent Brand 17O correction removes these discrepancies. The traditional 17O correction yields distinct temperature‐Δ47 calibration curves for synthetic carbonates precipitated using different methods to degas CO2, while the more recent 17O correction collapses all calibration data onto a single curve. Conclusions:The 17O correction strategy employed by CO2 and carbonate clumped‐isotope researchers can have a large effect on the accuracy of Δ47 values. Use of the traditional 17O correction may have caused errors in published studies as large as 0.1 ‰ and may account for Δ47 differences among laboratories and disagreement among previously published carbonate clumped isotope thermometry calibrations.

The late Cretaceous though the early Eocene is an intriguing period of Earth history because of the geologic evidence for globally warm climates that corresponds with high concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. Studying these high CO2 climates can potentially illuminate what high-CO2 climates will be like in the future. However, a couple of basic questions about these so-called greenhouse climate regimes drive the paleoclimate research.\nA first, seemingly simple, question is: how hot was it really? One way to quantify earth surface temperatures is by using the clumped isotope composition of soil carbonates that formed during that time period. I used a seres of stacked paleosols from Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA to estimate air temperatures in the subtropics (30 °N).\n  Sampling the Hannold Hill Formation in the heat.   My temperature estimates were intriguingly cold - I estimate summer temperatures of 32 °C, which is not that different from modern summer temperatures in the same place. Either I am interpreting the seasonal bias of my proxy incorrectly (see other projects), or the subtropics were surprisingly cool. Publication here.\nAnother aspect of this project is to determine if greenhouse climates were seasonally equable or not. To answer this, I helped my colleague Landon Burgener in his efforts to compare temperature estimates from a myriad of proxies that likely record different seasonal temperatures.
