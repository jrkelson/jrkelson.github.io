The isotopic composition of tooth enamel is widely used as a paleoenvironmental indicator and recent work suggests the potential for using the triple oxygen isotopic composition of the carbonate component of mammalian tooth enamel (Δ′17Oenamel) as an indicator of aridity. However, the extent to which Δ′17Oenamel values vary across environments is unknown and there is no framework for evaluating past aridity using Δ′17Oenamel data. Here we present Δ′17Oenamel and δ18Oenamel values from 50 extant mammalian herbivores that vary in physiology, behavior, diet, and water-use strategy. Teeth are from sites in Africa, Europe, and North America and represent a range of environments (humid to arid) and latitudes (34°S to 69°N), where mean annual δ18O values of meteoric water range from –26.0‰ to 2.2‰ (VSMOW). Δ′17Oenamel values from these sites span 162 per meg (–252 to –90 per meg), where 1 per meg = 0.001‰). The observed variation in Δ′17Oenamel values increases with aridity, forming a wedge-shaped pattern in a plot of aridity index vs. Δ′17Oenamel that persists regardless of geographic region. In contrast, the plot of aridity index vs. δ18Oenamel for these same samples does not yield a distinct pattern. We use these new Δ′17Oenamel data from extant teeth to provide guidelines for using Δ′17Oenamel data from fossil teeth to assess and classify the aridity of past environments. Δ′17Oenamel values from the fossil record have the potential to be a widely used proxy for aridity without the limitations inherent to approaches that use δ18Oenamel values alone. In addition, the data presented here have implications for how Δ′17Oenamel values of large mammalian herbivores can be used in evaluations of diagenesis and past pCO2 and past gross primary productivity.","tags":["aridity","triple oxygen isotopes","mammal teeth","paleoclimate"],"title":"Triple oxygen isotope distribution in modern mammal teeth and potential geologic applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Teaching experience:\nLecturer (Instructor of Record), University of Michigan, Camp Davis, Jackson Hole, WY 2022\nTeaching Assistant, University of Washington:\n-ESS 211 Physical Processes of the Earth (structural geology,geomorphology), Fall 2018\n-ESS 418 Geoscience Communication, Winter 2015 \u0026amp; 2014\n-ESS 400 Field Geology in Dillon, Montana, Summer 2014 \u0026amp; 2015\n-ESS 210 Physical Geology, Fall 2014 \u0026amp; Winter 2019\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also guest-lectured at various courses as a graduate student and a postdoc.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some fun pictures from teaching University of Michigan\u0026rsquo;s Earth 450, Ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains, based out of Camp Davis, Wyoming.\n  Reviewing glacial geomorphology from the Pinedale type-section in Pinedale, Wyoming     Describing soils and vegetation in the Rockies.

However, a multitude of hydrologic processes can affect δ18O values, including mixing, evaporation, distillation of parent waters, and carbonate growth temperatures. We combined traditional carbon and oxygen isotope analyses with clumped (Δ47) and triple oxygen isotopes (Δ′17O) analyses in oyster shells (Acutostrea idriaensis) of the Goler Formation in southern California (USA) to obtain insights into surface temperatures and δ18O values of meteoric waters during the early Eocene hothouse climate. The Δ47-derived temperatures ranged from 9 °C to 20 °C. We found a correlation between the δ18O of growth water (δ18Ogw) (calculated using Δ47 temperatures and δ18O of carbonate) and the δ13C values of shells. The Δ′17O values of shell growth waters (0.006‰–0.013‰ relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water–standard light Antarctic precipitation [VSMOW-SLAP]) calculated from Δ′17O of carbonate (−0.087‰ to −0.078‰ VSMOW-SLAP) were lower than typical meteoric waters. These isotopic compositions are consistent with oyster habitation in an estuary. We present a new triple oxygen isotope mixing model to estimate the δ18O value of freshwater supplying the estuary (δ18Ofw). The reconstructed δ18Ofw of −11.3‰ to −14.7‰ (VSMOW) is significantly lower than the δ18Ogw of −4.4‰ to −9.9‰ that would have been calculated using “only” Δ47 and δ18O values of carbonate. This δ18Ofw estimate supports paleogeographic reconstructions of a Paleogene river fed by high-elevation catchments of the paleo–southern Sierra Nevada. Our study highlights the potential for paired Δ47 and Δ′17O analyses to improve reconstructions of meteoric water δ18O, with implications for understanding ancient climates and elevations.","tags":["paleo-elevations","oyster shells","clumped isotopes","triple oxygen isotopes"],"title":"Looking upstream with clumped and triple oxygen isotopes of estuarine oyster shells in the early Eocene of California, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Licht","JR Kelson","S Bergel","A Schauer","SV Petersen","A Capirala","KW Huntington","G.

The mechanisms and timing of pedogenic carbonate formation are more ambiguous in the tropical domain, where long periods of soil water saturation and high soil respiration enhance calcite dissolution. This paper provides stable carbon, oxygen and clumped isotope values from Quaternary and Miocene pedogenic carbonates in the tropical domain of Myanmar, in areas characterized by warm (18°C) winters and annual rainfall up to 1,700 mm. We show that carbonate growth in Myanmar is delayed to the driest and coldest months of the year by sustained monsoonal rainfall from mid spring to late fall. The range of isotopic variability in Quaternary pedogenic carbonates can be solely explained by temporal changes of carbonate growth within the dry season, from winter to early spring. We propose that high soil moisture year-round in the tropical domain narrows carbonate growth to the driest months and makes it particularly sensitive to the seasonal distribution of rainfall. This sensitivity is also enabled by high winter temperatures, allowing carbonate growth to occur outside the warmest months of the year. This high sensitivity is expected to be more prominent in the geological record during times with higher temperatures and greater expansion of the tropical realm. Clumped isotope temperatures, δ13C and δ18O values of tropical pedogenic carbonates are impacted by changes of both rainfall seasonality and surface temperatures; this sensitivity can potentially be used to track past tropical rainfall distribution.","tags":["clumped isotopes","soil carbonates"],"title":"Dynamics of pedogenic carbonate growth in the monsoonal tropical domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Jimenez-Rodriguez","J Quade","M Dettinger","KW Huntington","J R Kelson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"b95fe4fc798ddb48dff2b58465ef6b0d","permalink":"/publication/jimenez-rodriguez_etal_2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimenez-rodriguez_etal_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Paleoaltimetry reconstructions of the Central Andes based on stable isotope data indicate variable timing and rates of uplift, reflecting the operation of multiple geodynamic mechanisms. There are a range of isotopic methods and proxies involved in these reconstructions, and it may be that biases inherent in some of these methods has led to misinterpretations. Here we explored the limitations of carbonate archives in reconstructing past elevations, including underestimation of paleoelevations by oxygen-isotope evaporative enrichment and carbonate formation in the subsurface. To conduct our test, we obtained stable isotope values of carbonates from the Western Cordillera in northern Chile at ~18.5–19.5°S, where previously published paleoaltimetry results from the same sections, based on the hydrogen stable isotope composition of volcanic glass, indicate that this region of the Andes has remained at high elevations (4.4 km) since at least ~23 Ma. We present new oxygen and carbon isotopic, and clumped isotopic results, petrographic and sedimentologic observations, as well as major element abundance (ICP-MS and microprobe analyses) from lacustrine carbonates (marlstones) and cements in sandstones of the early Miocene Chucal Formation in the central Andes of northern Chile. The clumped isotope paleotemperature estimates range from 26 to 45 °C in lacustrine carbonates and 27 to 54 °C in cements. These results indicate that carbonates from this section do not reflect surface temperatures, suggesting clumped isotope resetting in a rock-buffered setting for marlstones and carbonate formation at depth in the presence of groundwater for cements in sandstones. In contrast, the oxygen and carbon isotopic values from carbonates appear to be primary and combined with Mg/Ca ratios and Na concentrations document the transition from lake deposition into a dominantly fluvial environment within the Chucal Formation, also indicating variable evaporative conditions during deposition. The paleoaltimetry estimates in carbonates significantly underestimate the results determined in volcanic glass, with paleoelevation results ranging between 1.4 km and 2.6 km in marlstones and from 2.6 and 3.6 km in cements.. The results presented in this study highlight the importance of using multiple proxies for paleoaltimetry reconstructions, especially in arid land settings where meteoric waters have been modified by evaporation.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Comparing isotopic estimates of paleoelevation from carbonates and volcanic glass from the Miocene-age Chucal Formation in northern Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m excited that the first paper from my NSF EAR postdoc fellowship has been accepted for publication in Geology!

Then we analyzed the four carbonate standards along with three additional standards, spanning a broad range of δ47 and Δ47 values, for a total of 5,329 analyses on 25 individual mass spectrometers from 22 different laboratories. Treating three of the materials as known standards and the other four as unknowns, we find that the use of carbonate reference materials is a robust method for standardization that yields interlaboratory discrepancies entirely consistent with intralaboratory analytical uncertainties. Carbonate reference materials, along with measurement and data processing practices described herein, provide the carbonate clumped isotope community with a robust approach to achieve interlaboratory agreement as we continue to use and improve this powerful geochemical tool.

In particular, their oxygen isotope composition ($\\delta$18O) is used to reconstruct the $\\delta$18O of ancient meteoric waters.\nThe problem: To what extent is the $\\delta$18O of soil water (and resulting soil carbonate) modified by evaporation? If soil carbonates form during evaporative dewatering, it is likely that their parent water $\\delta$18O is modified by evaporation. If unrecognized, this could lead to erroneously high estimates of $\\delta$18O of ancient precipitation. On the other hand, if soil carbonates form as a result of rootwater uptake and/or respiration-induced changes in soil CO2, the parent water $\\delta$18O might be a faithful recorder of $\\delta$18O of meteoric waters.\nWhat we are doing: We are measuring the triple oxygen isotope composition of modern soil carbonates from various environments. Evaporation will cause a deviation from the expected relationship between $\\delta$17O and $\\delta$18O in water and resulting carbonate (Figure 1) (Landais et al., 2006; Luz and Barkan, 2010; Passey et al., 2014; Gázquez et al., 2018; Surma et al., 2018; Passey and Levin, in review). Thus the ∆’17O composition of soil carbonates should indicate the extent to which their parent soil waters were evaporated (Primer on Triple Oxygen Isotopes here).\n   Figure 1: Schematic of relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O (left panel) and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and ∆\u0026rsquo;17O (right panel). ∆\u0026rsquo;17O is insensitive to the $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O of the carbonate parent water. Evaporated waters will have low ∆\u0026rsquo;17O values relative to their parent waters.    Triple Oxygen Isotope Results Preliminary results: Soil carbonate ∆’17O ranges from approximately -170 to -110 per meg, which corresponds with parent waters that range from -35 to + 25 per meg (Methods below) (Figure 2). These values are generally lower than unevaporated meteoric waters (i.e., rain and rivers), and at the lowest, resemble evaporated meteoric waters (i.e., closed basin lakes). Thus far, a complicated relationship between aridity and ∆’17O of soil carbonates is emerging. We speculate that there might be the hint of some kind of “threshold aridity.” Below such a threshold aridity (more arid) we observe a spread in ∆’17O. Above such a threshold (less arid) we observe relatively high ∆’17O values of soil waters (less evaporation). This pattern might indicate that soil carbonates form during evaporation in the most arid environments (aridity index, AI, \u0026lt; 0.2). In semi-arid to humid environments (AI \u0026gt; 0.2), soil carbonate forms via other processes and/or soil waters are regularly recharged with non-evaporated waters. In such an environment, $\\delta$18O of soil carbonates might be more reliable recorders of rainfall $\\delta$18O.\n   Figure 2: Reconstructed soil water ∆’17O (black dots) and ∆’17O of meteoric waters (Aron et al., Chem Geo, in prep) (colored dots). Reconstructed soil water ∆’17O values are low compared to most meteoric waters; we interpret this pattern as indicating that many soil waters overprinted by some amount of evaporation.      Figure 3: Calculated ∆’17O of soil waters reconstructed from soil carbonates. Aridity index (AI) is calculated as the mean annual precipitation (MAP) divided by potential evapotranspiration (PET) using WorldClim data (Beverly et al., 2019; Fick and Hijmans 2017). The black outline indicates data that is newly presented in this work (measurements made at the University of Michigan). The data from Texas, USA are from Ji (2016); all other data are from Passey et al. (2014).   \nBonus: Modeling of Triple Oxygen Isotopes in a Soil Profile Evaporation only: We’ve started to model ∆’17O in a soil profile using the TOUGHREACT numerical simulation program. Below, we have plotted monthly time steps for a 1-D soil profile undergoing one year of evaporation (Figure 4). The model is isothermal, atmospheric relative humidity is set to 40 %, and the model does not incorporate transpiration. The year of evaporation results in an enormous ∆’17O-soil water excursion – up to -100 per meg lower than starting ∆’17O (0 per meg) [see also the similar theoretical profile of Barnes and Allison (1983)]. Because a year of uninterrupted evaporation would only occur in the driest locations on earth (e.g., the non-vegetated Atacama Desert), this scenario shows the maximum potential effect of evaporation on ∆’17O-soil water and therefore ∆’17O-soil carbonate.\n   Figure 4: Modeling D’17O of a soil profile. One year of evaporation (isothermal soil profile).   A little more realistic: To give a sense of the range of ∆’17O-soil water in a more realistic scenario, we modeled the Adams Ranch Soil Climate Analysis Network site in central New Mexico, a semi-arid environment (mean annual precipitation of 230 mm/yr) where soil carbonate readily forms. As above, we modeled an isothermal, non-vegetated system (soil temperature = 15 °C, atmospheric relative humidity = 44 %). Figure 5 below shows the evolution of soil water ∆’17O after the largest rain event on record (initial value of +35 per meg) from 2011–2015, ending just before the next rain event (Figure 5). The results suggest that ∆’17O excursions of up to 20-25 per meg are possible from evaporation alone, although after most rain events ∆’17O-soil water only changes by 10-15 per meg before the next infiltration event.\n   Figure 5: Time steps of ∆’17O-soil water after the September 10, 2013 rain event at Adam’s Ranch, New Mexico. The ∆’17O of soil water resets to the rainfall value (+35 per meg) after a storm, then evolves to lower ∆’17O with drying; the plot stops at 35 days, just before the next rain event. Soil profile is held at 15 °C, atmosphere at 12.5 °C.   \nConclusions Implications for paleoclimate reconstructions:\n ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil carbonates can identify if parent soil waters have been evaporated. This will help workers evaluate the fidelity of their record for reconstructing $\\delta$18O of meteoric waters. ∆\u0026rsquo;17O promises to shed light on soil carbonate formation processes, with implications on how to interpret other stable isotope data from this widely used material. Preliminary data suggests that ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil carbonates relates to local aridity. More data will be required to establish this measurement as a true proxy for aridity.  Future work:\n Firstly, we need to finish the replicate analyses that were aborted when the University of Michigan shut down to slow the spread of Sars-Cov-2. We’re also interested in adding to our soil carbonate collection. We plan to explore other environmental factors (i.e., external constraints on timing of carbonate formation, seasonality of precipitation, vegetation type, etc.) that might also explain the ∆’17O variation that we observe. Observations of local meteoric water ∆\u0026rsquo;17O would give context to our reconstructed soil water values. We are just starting numerical modeling of ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil waters (link to bonus figures below) Future, future work: measurements of ∆\u0026rsquo;17O of soil water made through a seasonal cycle would be very useful.   Do you have samples to contribute? We are still expanding our collection of soil carbonate samples to include in this study. We are most interested in soil carbonate samples that already have some kind of environmental or isotope context (i.e., stable and/or clumped isotope data, water isotope data, vegetation information, etc.). If you have samples from anywhere in the world that you’d like to share with us, please get in touch!\nAcknowledgements This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1854873 to JRK.

We are using the acid digestion/reduction/fluorination method described in Passey et al. (2014). Multiple analyses of VSMOW2 and SLAP2 are performed during each analytical session and form the basis for normalization to the VSMOW-SLAP reference frame (Schoenemann et al., 2013). International carbonate standards (NBS-18, NBS-19, IAEA 603) are analyzed along with unknowns, and an internal carbonate standard (102-GC-AZ01) is used to correct for systematic drift in ∆’17O that is observed in some analytical sessions. The data shown in this presentation were analyzed in two analytical sessions (as established by CoF3 reactors number 13 and 14 at IPL). These sessions spanned from December 2019 to March 2020.\n Where shown, ∆’17O of soil waters is reconstructed from the soil carbonates using the ∆’17O of soil carbonate, an estimate of growth temperature from clumped isotopes (∆47) and a combined mineral-water and acid fractionation factor of $\\theta$a-c-w = 0.5242 (Passey et al., 2014). The 18$\\alpha$a-c-w is calculated using the equation from Kim and O\u0026rsquo;Neil (1997) and multiplied by an acid fractionation factor of 1.0081 for acid digestion of calcite at 90 °C (Kim et al., 2007):\n18\u0026frasl;16$\\alpha$a-c-w = 1.0081*$e^{((18030/(T)-32.42)/1000)}$\n$\\theta$a-c-w = ln(17\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-c-w)/ln(18\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-c-w)\nwhere T is carbonate growth temperature in Kelvin.\n Error bars in ∆’17O are 1 standard error, which is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of 0.018 (long-term SD of an internal carbonate standard, 102-GC-AZ01) by the square root of the number of replicate analyses.\n  References Aron, P.G., Levin, N.E., Beverly, E.J., Huth, T.E., Passey, B.H., Pelletier, E.M., Poulsen, C.J., Winkelstern, I.Z., Yarian, D.A.

A measurement of the abundance of 18O is widely used in geochemistry ($\\delta$18O) as a tracer for hydrologic processes. It was long assumed that stuyding 17O would not yield additional useful information because the fractionation would be about half that of 18O, following a relationship that is predicted by mass-dependent (equilibrium) fractionation ($\\theta$ = 0.529 for equilibrium fractionation, Luz and Barkan 2010):\n  Figure 1: Predicted relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O given equilibrium fractionation. $\\theta$a-b = ln(17\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-b)/ln(18\u0026frasl;16 $\\alpha$a-b), where $\\alpha$a-b is the fractionation factor between two phases (like calcite-water).   Note that the axes of Figure 1 use “delta-prime” notation, a slight variation on the more familiar delta notation. This notation is used to remove the slight curvature in the relationship between $\\delta$18O and $\\delta$17O (Miller, 2002):\n$\\delta$’x = ln($\\delta$x+1)\n$\\delta$17O can deviate from this relationship if non-equilibrium fractionation occurs (i.e., $\\theta$ ≠ 0.529). Evaporation is an example of one such fractionation process that carries $\\theta$ = 0.5185 (Barkan and Luz, 2007). Yes, 0.5185 might seem about the same as .529, but with sufficiently high precision instruments this deviation can be measured. This deviation from the expected relationship between $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O and $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O is called ∆’17O, (analogous to the familiar d-excess), and is defined as:\n$\\Delta$’17O = $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;17O – $\\lambda$ * $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O\n  Figure 2: Schematic of $\\Delta$\u0026rsquo;17O   Note that I\u0026rsquo;ve used $\\lambda$ = 0.528, which is the empirically observed relationship in meteoric waters (Luz and Barkan 2010). The $\\lambda$ notation expresses that it is an empirical relationship that may combine a number of different fractionations, as opposed to the $\\theta$ used above that describes a single, well-defined fractionation (like the equilibrium fractionation, diffusion, or acid fractionation). ∆’17O is expressed in permille (with values that ranges from +0.10 to -0.2), or in per meg (with values that range from +100 to -200).\nThus, $\\Delta$’17O can be used to identify evaporation of parent waters and carbonate minerals. Measuring $\\Delta$’17O promises to be useful in terrestrial hydroclimate where d18O alone can be ambiguous. Let’s consider the water bottle of Seattle tap water ($\\delta$18O = -10 ‰) that I accidentally brought with me when I moved to in Michigan last fall. If I let this water bottle sit with a lid off, it would evaporate and eventually reach a $\\delta$18O= -6 ‰. At that point, it would be impossible to distinguish my imported Seattle water from that of local Ann Arbor tap water using $\\delta$18O analyses. $\\Delta$’17O could be used to readily identify which water was evaporated; the Seattle water would have a $\\Delta$’17O value that is about 0.10 ‰ lower than that of the Michigan water (evaporation experiments in Li et al., 2017).\n$\\Delta$’17O has the potential to be useful in addition to the more familiar d-excess for two reasons. The first is the fractionation in oxygen isotopes is not very sensitive to temperature (i.e., Angert et al., 2004). The second is that carbonate minerals are widely preserved in the geologic record, where it is difficult to find co-occurring preservation of hydrogen and oxygen that would be necessary to calculate d-excess. Furthermore, the growth temperature can be directly measured from the same carbonate mineral (using clumps), allowing for a simultaneous estimate of environmental temperature and hydrologic processes.\n  Figure 3: Schematic of $\\Delta$\u0026rsquo;17O vs $\\delta$\u0026rsquo;18O in waters   In studies of paleo-hydroclimate, we could use ∆’17O to parse out if changes in $\\delta$18O were due to Rayleigh distillation (i.e., rainout over a mountain range) or due to evaporation. Other processes that cause kinetic fractionation could also be investigated (i.e., speleothems, as predicted in Guo and Zhou, 2019). Note that ∆’17O should be independent of the starting $\\delta$18O composition. It might even be possible to use the ∆’17O of carbonates to reconstruct the $\\delta$18O of primary meteoric waters (i.e., lake carbonates in Passey and Ji, 2019).\nMeasuring ∆’17O in carbonate materials posed a technical challenge to isotope geochemists. Usually the isotopic composition of a carbonate mineral is determined by first digesting the CaCO3 in phosphoric acid, then measuring the isotope abundances in the evolved CO2 gas. However, 13C-16O-16O interferes with the measurement of 12C-17O-16O. So, CO2 gas evolved from solid CaCO3 needs to be converted to O2 for measurement. Passey et al. (2014) describe the acid digestion, reduction, and fluorination method which is currently in place at the University of Michigan.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"d49c532573dbaf14074a1c5641671dd5","permalink":"/primer/tripleoprimer/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/primer/tripleoprimer/","section":"primer","summary":"What are all those primes for anyway?","tags":["project","methods","triple oxygen isotopes"],"title":"Triple Oxygen Isotopes","type":"primer"},{"authors":["JR Kelson","KW Huntington","DO Breecker","LK Burgener","TM Gallagher","GD Hoke","SV Petersen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"00b5b941f585392390bbc57e444428a3","permalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Soil carbonates are important paleoclimate archives, but interpretations of their isotopic compositions (ẟ18O, ẟ13C, and ∆47) are hampered by uncertainty in the annual timing of their accumulation. Several previous studies have inferred the annual timing of soil carbonate formation by comparing modern air/soil temperatures with temperatures estimated from the clumped isotopic composition (T∆47) of Holocene soil carbonates. Here, we compile the existing ∆47 data to first consider if recent changes in ∆47 standardization methods alters the apparent seasonal biases. Then we explore the importance of various environmental parameters on soil carbonate T∆47 and discuss implications for associated paleoclimate reconstructions. Most soil carbonates record T∆47 values higher than mean annual air temperature, but the residual varies from -4 to +24 °C. ∆47 values for most observed soil profiles do not vary with depth. We find that the grain size of the soil matrix, timing of precipitation, and presence of vegetation each explain a portion of the observed variance in seasonal bias and can be used to aid in interpretations of T∆47 values from paleosols. In some soil carbonates, a warm-season bias in T∆47 is accompanied with calculated ẟ18O values of soil water that appear to be biased toward the ẟ18O of summer rainfall. Most estimated values of ẟ18O of soil water are within 2 ‰ of the ẟ18O values of mean annual rainfall.  Where possible, paleoclimate reconstructions should consider precipitation timing, soil texture, and vegetation cover to aid in identifying the seasonal bias of soil carbonate stable isotopic compositions.","tags":["clumped isotopes","soil carbonates"],"title":"A proxy for all seasons?

The absolute abundance of heavy isotopes in the universal standards VPDB and VSMOW (defined by four parameters: R13VPDB, R17VSMOW, R18VSMOW, and λ) impact calculated Δ47 values. Here, we investigate whether use of updated and more accurate values for these parameters can remove observed interlaboratory differences in the measured T‐Δ47 relationship. Using the updated parameters, we reprocess 14 published calibration data sets measured in 11 different laboratories, representing many mineralogies, bulk compositions, sample types, reaction temperatures, and sample preparation and analysis methods. Exploiting this large composite data set (n = 1,253 sample replicates), we investigate the possibility for a “universal” clumped isotope calibration. We find that applying updated parameters improves the T‐Δ47 relationship (reduces residuals) within most labs and improves overall agreement but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We reaffirm earlier findings that different mineralogies do not require different calibration equations and that cleaning procedures, method of pressure baseline correction, and mass spectrometer type do not affect interlaboratory agreement. We also present new estimates of the temperature dependence of the acid digestion fractionation for Δ47 (Δ*25‐X), based on combining reprocessed data from four studies, and new theoretical equilibrium values to be used in calculation of the empirical transfer function.

Upper Cretaceous terrestrial climate proxies have been interpreted as evidence for “equable” climates with reduced seasonal variations in temperature. However, climate models have largely failed to reproduce these reconstructions unless parameters such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations are set to unreasonable values. To help resolve such model-proxy disagreements, we reconstruct mean annual range in temperature (MART) for the Campanian (~75 Ma) Kaiparowits (south-central Utah) and Two Medicine (northwest Montana) Formations using warmest mean monthly temperature reconstructions from the clumped isotope composition of paleosol carbonate nodules, and reconstructions of local mean annual air temperatures from other methods. An evaluation of the applicability of bulk elemental soil geochemistry temperature proxies in these deposits supports the use of previous leaf physiognomy-based estimates of mean annual temperature for our MART reconstructions. We test the validity of several common assumptions made in reconstructing MART in two novel ways. First, MART is commonly calculated as twice the difference between local mean annual air temperature and warmest mean monthly temperature, and we validate this method by estimating modern MART for a range of environments using climate reanalysis data. Second, we constrain the effect of radiative soil heating on our soil carbonate temperature estimates by showing that for most environments likely to be preserved in the geologic record, summer soil temperatures are 9 °C) larger than previous proxy reconstructions of Late Cretaceous MART. These results add to a growing body of literature showing that terrestrial MART during ancient greenhouse periods was not significantly different from modern seasonal temperature variations. Finally, the similarity in MART between the Kaiparowits and Two Medicine formations suggests that latitudinal changes in MART did not contribute to the faunal provincialism that has been proposed by some paleontologists.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Revisiting the equable climate problem during the Late Cretaceous greenhouse using paleosol carbonate clumped isotope temperatures from the Campanian of the Western Interior Basin, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Kelson","D Watford","C Bataille","KW Huntington","E Hyland","GJ Bowen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539216000,"objectID":"30a720329b9322be4d72e0af7f3c473c","permalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Records of subtropical climate on land from the early Paleogene offer insights into how the Earth system responds to greenhouse climate conditions. Fluvial and floodplain deposits of the Tornillo Basin (Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA) preserve a record of environmental and climatic change of the Paleocene and the early Eocene. We report carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotopic compositions (δ13C, δ18O, and Δ47) of paleosol carbonate nodules from this basin. Mineralogical, geochemical, and thermal modeling evidence suggests that the measured isotopic values preserve primary environmental signals with a summer bias with the exception of data from two nodules reset by local igneous intrusions. The unaltered nodules record Δ47 temperatures of 25 ± 4 and 32 ± 2 °C for the Paleocene and early Eocene nodules, respectively, showing an increase in average summer temperatures of 7 ± 3 °C. Calculations of δ18O of soil water are −2.8 ± 0.7‰ and −0.8 ± 0.4‰ (standard mean ocean water) for the early‐mid‐Paleocene and late Paleocene‐early Eocene, showing an increase of 2.0 ± 0.9‰. The increase in temperature and δ18O values likely relates to a rise in atmospheric pCO2, although we cannot rule out that changes in paleosol texture and regional precipitation patterns also influence the record. Comparison with Δ47 estimates of summer temperature from the Green River and Bighorn Basins (WY) highlights that terrestrial surface temperatures are heterogeneous, and latitudinal temperature gradients on land remain undetermined. Previously published paleoclimate models predict summer temperatures that are 2 to 6 °C higher than our estimate; discrepancies between climate models and proxy data persist at lower latitudes.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Warm Terrestrial Subtropics During the Paleocene and Eocene: Carbonate Clumped Isotope (Δ47) Evidence From the Tornillo Basin, Texas (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537538400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537538400,"objectID":"dc9017504b3be6a9e93c84f297d22142","permalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","publishdate":"2018-11-12T10:23:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates"],"title":"Carbonate Clumped Isotopes: Certainties and Uncertainties of Thermometry and Eocene Subtropical Paleoclimate","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"When do soil carbonates form?

In the CO2 molecule above, there are heavy isotopes (18O and 13C) bonded together. (FYI, their common/light counterparts are 12C and 16O). This makes for a molecule with an atomic mass of 47, hence the common ∆47 notation for \u0026lsquo;clumped isotopes\u0026rsquo;. Conveniently for paleoclimatologist, the rare/heavy isotopes preferentially clump at lower temperatures.\n  But how does this work? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a balloon full of CO2 gas with a fixed number of light and heavy isotopes each. In a balloon held at 1000 °C, the system is chaotic. Bonds are vibrating and wiggling and nothing really settles down. In this high-temperature system, the heavy and light isotopes end up being randomly distributed amongst the molecules.\n  Only one clumpy molecule in the hot balloon. Heavy isotopes are dark colors, light isotopes are light colors.   In a balloon held at lower temperatures (\u0026lt;1000 °C), the system can reach a more energetically favorable state. Clumping heavy isotopes together is favorable because it slightly reduces the vibrational energy and increases bond strength. So more clumps will occur at lower temperatures.\n  Three clumpy molecules in the cold balloon. Note same number of heavy isotopes.   Thus, clumped isotope geochemistry is not concerned with the total number of heavy isotopes in a system, but rather how those heavy isotopes are arranged within the molecules. We do need to know the number of heavy isotopes in the system, though, so we can calculate how many clumps we would expect if they were randomly arranged vs. how many we actually have measured. Then, we can estimate the temperature at which that CO2 molecule formed!\nUsually, what is measured is the clumpiness of CO2 gas that we get by digesting a carbonate mineral in acid. Common targets are soil carbonates and shells. With a little bit more work (see other projects), we can use the clumpiness we measure to estimate temperatures at or near the surface of the Earth millions of years ago.

The most commonly suggested causes of these discrepancies are the method of mineral precipitation and analytical differences, including the temperature of phosphoric acid used to digest carbonates. However, these mechanisms have yet to be tested in a consistent analytical setting, which makes it difficult to isolate the cause(s) of discrepancies and to evaluate which synthetic calibration is most appropriate for natural samples. Here, we systematically explore the impact of synthetic carbonate precipitation by replicating precipitation experiments of previous workers under a constant analytical setting. We (1) precipitate 56 synthetic carbonates at temperatures of 4–85 °C using different procedures to degas CO2, with and without the use of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to promote rapid dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) equilibration; (2) digest samples in phosphoric acid at both 90 °C and 25 °C; and (3) hold constant all analytical methods including acid preparation, CO2 purification, and mass spectrometry; and (4) reduce our data with 17O corrections that are appropriate for our samples. We find that the CO2 degassing method does not influence Δ47 values of these synthetic carbonates, and therefore probably only influences natural samples with very rapid degassing rates, like speleothems that precipitate out of drip solution with high pCO2. CA in solution does not influence Δ47 values in this work, suggesting that disequilibrium in the DIC pool is negligible. We also find the Δ47 values of samples reacted in 25 and 90 °C acid are within error of each other (once corrected with a constant acid fractionation factor). Taken together, our results show that the Δ47-temperature relationship does not measurably change with either the precipitation methods used in this study or acid digestion temperature. This leaves phosphoric acid preparation, CO2 gas purification, and/or data reduction methods as the possible sources of the discrepancy among published calibrations. In particular, the use of appropriate 17O corrections has the potential to reduce disagreement among calibrations. Our study nearly doubles the available synthetic carbonate calibration data for Δ47 thermometry (adding 56 samples to the 74 previously published samples). This large population size creates a robust calibration that enables us to examine the potential for calibration slope aliasing due to small sample size. The similarity of Δ47 values among carbonates precipitated under such diverse conditions suggests that many natural samples grown at 4–85 °C in moderate pH conditions (6–10) may also be described by our Δ47-temperature relationship.","tags":["clumped isotopes","calibrations","methods development"],"title":"Toward a universal carbonate clumped isotope calibration: Diverse synthesis and preparatory methods suggest a single temperature relationship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AJ Schauer","JR Kelson","C Saenger","KW Huntington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474416000,"objectID":"353bccfa5a7162dac9044e05d76e75a0","permalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Rationale: The clumped isotope composition of CO2 (Δ47) derived from carbonate is widely used as a paleotemperature proxy with broad applications in geoscience. Its accuracy is, however, limited by inter‐laboratory discrepancies of reference materials and disagreement among carbonate geothermometer calibrations. Here we show how the correction for the abundance of 17O influences these discrepancies. Methods:We used CO2‐H2O equilibration at known temperatures and phosphoric acid digested carbonates to generate CO2 samples with a wide range in 13C and 18O compositions. All samples were purified using an offline vacuum line. We used a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Faraday collector array for m/z 44–49, to measure δ13C, δ18O, δ47, and Δ47 values. Data were compiled using a traditional correction (‘Santrock’) for the 17O interference in m/z 45 as well as a more recently proposed correction (‘Brand’) for 17O interference. Two reference frames using CO2 with distinct 13C compositions were constructed to simulate an inter‐laboratory comparison. Results: The traditional Santrock 17O correction leads to a simulated Δ47 inter‐laboratory comparison offset of 0.06 ‰, and a 0.1 ‰ Δ47 range in CO2‐H2O 23°C equilibrations that is dependent on the 13C composition. The more recent Brand 17O correction removes these discrepancies. The traditional 17O correction yields distinct temperature‐Δ47 calibration curves for synthetic carbonates precipitated using different methods to degas CO2, while the more recent 17O correction collapses all calibration data onto a single curve. Conclusions:The 17O correction strategy employed by CO2 and carbonate clumped‐isotope researchers can have a large effect on the accuracy of Δ47 values. Use of the traditional 17O correction may have caused errors in published studies as large as 0.1 ‰ and may account for Δ47 differences among laboratories and disagreement among previously published carbonate clumped isotope thermometry calibrations.

One way to quantify earth surface temperatures is by using the clumped isotope composition of soil carbonates that formed during that time period. I used a seres of stacked paleosols from Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA to estimate air temperatures in the subtropics (30 °N).\n  Sampling the Hannold Hill Formation in the heat.   My temperature estimates were intriguingly cold - I estimate summer temperatures of 32 °C, which is not that different from modern summer temperatures in the same place. Either I am interpreting the seasonal bias of my proxy incorrectly (see other projects), or the subtropics were surprisingly cool. Publication here.\nAnother aspect of this project is to determine if greenhouse climates were seasonally equable or not. To answer this, I helped my colleague Landon Burgener in his efforts to compare temperature estimates from a myriad of proxies that likely record different seasonal temperatures. We looked at Cretaceous paleosol deposits in Utah and Montana. Publication here.\n  Field work in the Kaiparowits Formation, Utah.   I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a late Paleocene to early Eocene record from the Goler Formation in California. This is another stratigraphic record of coastal hothouse climates. There are beautifully preserved oyster shells. Through measuring the clumped and triple oxygen isotopes in these oysters, we\u0026rsquo;re learning about upstream hydrology, temperatures, and paleoaltimetry. More results coming soon here!\n  Eocene oyster shell from the Goler Fm, CA.
