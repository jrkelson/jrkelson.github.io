The absolute abundance of heavy isotopes in the universal standards VPDB and VSMOW (defined by four parameters: R13VPDB, R17VSMOW, R18VSMOW, and λ) impact calculated Δ47 values. Here, we investigate whether use of updated and more accurate values for these parameters can remove observed interlaboratory differences in the measured T‐Δ47 relationship. Using the updated parameters, we reprocess 14 published calibration data sets measured in 11 different laboratories, representing many mineralogies, bulk compositions, sample types, reaction temperatures, and sample preparation and analysis methods. Exploiting this large composite data set (n = 1,253 sample replicates), we investigate the possibility for a “universal” clumped isotope calibration. We find that applying updated parameters improves the T‐Δ47 relationship (reduces residuals) within most labs and improves overall agreement but does not eliminate all interlaboratory differences. We reaffirm earlier findings that different mineralogies do not require different calibration equations and that cleaning procedures, method of pressure baseline correction, and mass spectrometer type do not affect interlaboratory agreement. We also present new estimates of the temperature dependence of the acid digestion fractionation for Δ47 (Δ*25‐X), based on combining reprocessed data from four studies, and new theoretical equilibrium values to be used in calculation of the empirical transfer function. Overall, we have ruled out a number of possible causes of interlaboratory disagreement in the T‐Δ47 relationship, but many more remain to be investigated.","tags":["clumped isotopes","calibrations","methods development"],"title":"Effects of Improved 17O Correction on Interlaboratory Agreement in Clumped Isotope Calibrations, Estimates of Mineral‐Specific Offsets, and Temperature Dependence of Acid Digestion Fractionation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nicole culminated her 2 years of undergraduate research with a presentation at the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium.

Upper Cretaceous terrestrial climate proxies have been interpreted as evidence for “equable” climates with reduced seasonal variations in temperature. However, climate models have largely failed to reproduce these reconstructions unless parameters such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations are set to unreasonable values. To help resolve such model-proxy disagreements, we reconstruct mean annual range in temperature (MART) for the Campanian (~75 Ma) Kaiparowits (south-central Utah) and Two Medicine (northwest Montana) Formations using warmest mean monthly temperature reconstructions from the clumped isotope composition of paleosol carbonate nodules, and reconstructions of local mean annual air temperatures from other methods. An evaluation of the applicability of bulk elemental soil geochemistry temperature proxies in these deposits supports the use of previous leaf physiognomy-based estimates of mean annual temperature for our MART reconstructions. We test the validity of several common assumptions made in reconstructing MART in two novel ways. First, MART is commonly calculated as twice the difference between local mean annual air temperature and warmest mean monthly temperature, and we validate this method by estimating modern MART for a range of environments using climate reanalysis data. Second, we constrain the effect of radiative soil heating on our soil carbonate temperature estimates by showing that for most environments likely to be preserved in the geologic record, summer soil temperatures are 9 °C) larger than previous proxy reconstructions of Late Cretaceous MART. These results add to a growing body of literature showing that terrestrial MART during ancient greenhouse periods was not significantly different from modern seasonal temperature variations. Finally, the similarity in MART between the Kaiparowits and Two Medicine formations suggests that latitudinal changes in MART did not contribute to the faunal provincialism that has been proposed by some paleontologists.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Revisiting the equable climate problem during the Late Cretaceous greenhouse using paleosol carbonate clumped isotope temperatures from the Campanian of the Western Interior Basin, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Kelson","D Watford","C Bataille","KW Huntington","E Hyland","GJ Bowen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539216000,"objectID":"30a720329b9322be4d72e0af7f3c473c","permalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelson_etal_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Records of subtropical climate on land from the early Paleogene offer insights into how the Earth system responds to greenhouse climate conditions.

We report carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotopic compositions (δ13C, δ18O, and Δ47) of paleosol carbonate nodules from this basin. Mineralogical, geochemical, and thermal modeling evidence suggests that the measured isotopic values preserve primary environmental signals with a summer bias with the exception of data from two nodules reset by local igneous intrusions. The unaltered nodules record Δ47 temperatures of 25 ± 4 and 32 ± 2 °C for the Paleocene and early Eocene nodules, respectively, showing an increase in average summer temperatures of 7 ± 3 °C. Calculations of δ18O of soil water are −2.8 ± 0.7‰ and −0.8 ± 0.4‰ (standard mean ocean water) for the early‐mid‐Paleocene and late Paleocene‐early Eocene, showing an increase of 2.0 ± 0.9‰. The increase in temperature and δ18O values likely relates to a rise in atmospheric pCO2, although we cannot rule out that changes in paleosol texture and regional precipitation patterns also influence the record. Comparison with Δ47 estimates of summer temperature from the Green River and Bighorn Basins (WY) highlights that terrestrial surface temperatures are heterogeneous, and latitudinal temperature gradients on land remain undetermined. Previously published paleoclimate models predict summer temperatures that are 2 to 6 °C higher than our estimate; discrepancies between climate models and proxy data persist at lower latitudes.","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates","soil carbonates"],"title":"Warm Terrestrial Subtropics During the Paleocene and Eocene: Carbonate Clumped Isotope (Δ47) Evidence From the Tornillo Basin, Texas (USA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537538400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537538400,"objectID":"dc9017504b3be6a9e93c84f297d22142","permalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","publishdate":"2018-11-12T10:23:37-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wce_seminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["clumped isotopes","greenhouse climates"],"title":"Carbonate Clumped Isotopes: Certainties and Uncertainties of Thermometry and Eocene Subtropical Paleoclimate","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am researching how and when soil carbonates form.

In the CO2 molecule above, there are heavy isotopes (18O and 13C) bonded together. (FYI, their common/light counterparts are 12C and 16O). This makes for a molecule with an atomic mass of 47, hence the common ∆47 notation for \u0026lsquo;clumped isotopes\u0026rsquo;. Conveniently for paleoclimatologist, the rare/heavy isotopes preferentially clump at lower temperatures.\n  But how does this work? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a ballon full of CO2 gas with a fixed number of light and heavy isotopes each. In a ballon held at 1000 °C, the system is chaotic. Bonds are vibrating and wiggling and nothing really settles down. In this high-temperature system, the heavy and light isotopes end up being randomly distributed amongst the molecules.\n  Only one clumpy molecule in the hot balloon. Heavy isotopes are dark colors, light isotopes are light colors.   In a ballon held at lower temperatures (\u0026lt;1000 °C), the system can reach a more energetically favorable state. Clumping heavy isotopes together is favorable because it slightly reduces the vibrational energy and increases bond strength. So more clumps will occur at lower temperatures.\n  Three clumpy molecules in the cold balloon. Note same number of heavy isotopes.   Thus, clumped isotope geochemistry is not concerned with the total number of heavy isotopes in a system, but rather how those heavy isotopes are arranged within the molecules. We do need to know the number of heavy isotopes in the system, though, so we can calculate how many clumps we would expect if they were randomly arranged vs. how many we actually have measured. Then, we can estimate the temperature at which that CO2 molecule formed!\nUsually, what is measured is the clumpiness of CO2 gas that we get by digesting a carbonate mineral in acid. Common targets are soil carbonates and shells. With a little bit more work (see other projects), we can use the clumpiness we measure to estimate temperatures at or near the surface of the Earth millions of years ago. This thermometer is not based on biology nor does it depend on the isotopic composition of the water from which the mineral grew. That makes for a powerful, quantitative thermometer.\n","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"fac1a5015d10ab5a2dcff7dbfc890b53","permalink":"/primer/clumpy/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/primer/clumpy/","section":"primer","summary":"What is clumped isotope thermometry and is it real?","tags":["project","methods","clumped isotopes"],"title":"A primer","type":"primer"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The first measurements of ∆47 of CO2 gas evolved from carbonates were published in 2006 by Ghosh et al.

The most commonly suggested causes of these discrepancies are the method of mineral precipitation and analytical differences, including the temperature of phosphoric acid used to digest carbonates. However, these mechanisms have yet to be tested in a consistent analytical setting, which makes it difficult to isolate the cause(s) of discrepancies and to evaluate which synthetic calibration is most appropriate for natural samples. Here, we systematically explore the impact of synthetic carbonate precipitation by replicating precipitation experiments of previous workers under a constant analytical setting. We (1) precipitate 56 synthetic carbonates at temperatures of 4–85 °C using different procedures to degas CO2, with and without the use of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to promote rapid dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) equilibration; (2) digest samples in phosphoric acid at both 90 °C and 25 °C; and (3) hold constant all analytical methods including acid preparation, CO2 purification, and mass spectrometry; and (4) reduce our data with 17O corrections that are appropriate for our samples. We find that the CO2 degassing method does not influence Δ47 values of these synthetic carbonates, and therefore probably only influences natural samples with very rapid degassing rates, like speleothems that precipitate out of drip solution with high pCO2. CA in solution does not influence Δ47 values in this work, suggesting that disequilibrium in the DIC pool is negligible. We also find the Δ47 values of samples reacted in 25 and 90 °C acid are within error of each other (once corrected with a constant acid fractionation factor). Taken together, our results show that the Δ47-temperature relationship does not measurably change with either the precipitation methods used in this study or acid digestion temperature. This leaves phosphoric acid preparation, CO2 gas purification, and/or data reduction methods as the possible sources of the discrepancy among published calibrations. In particular, the use of appropriate 17O corrections has the potential to reduce disagreement among calibrations. Our study nearly doubles the available synthetic carbonate calibration data for Δ47 thermometry (adding 56 samples to the 74 previously published samples). This large population size creates a robust calibration that enables us to examine the potential for calibration slope aliasing due to small sample size. The similarity of Δ47 values among carbonates precipitated under such diverse conditions suggests that many natural samples grown at 4–85 °C in moderate pH conditions (6–10) may also be described by our Δ47-temperature relationship.","tags":["clumped isotopes","calibrations","methods development"],"title":"Toward a universal carbonate clumped isotope calibration: Diverse synthesis and preparatory methods suggest a single temperature relationship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AJ Schauer","JR Kelson","C Saenger","KW Huntington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474416000,"objectID":"353bccfa5a7162dac9044e05d76e75a0","permalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schauer_etal_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Rationale: The clumped isotope composition of CO2 (Δ47) derived from carbonate is widely used as a paleotemperature proxy with broad applications in geoscience. Its accuracy is, however, limited by inter‐laboratory discrepancies of reference materials and disagreement among carbonate geothermometer calibrations. Here we show how the correction for the abundance of 17O influences these discrepancies. Methods:We used CO2‐H2O equilibration at known temperatures and phosphoric acid digested carbonates to generate CO2 samples with a wide range in 13C and 18O compositions. All samples were purified using an offline vacuum line. We used a Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Faraday collector array for m/z 44–49, to measure δ13C, δ18O, δ47, and Δ47 values. Data were compiled using a traditional correction (‘Santrock’) for the 17O interference in m/z 45 as well as a more recently proposed correction (‘Brand’) for 17O interference. Two reference frames using CO2 with distinct 13C compositions were constructed to simulate an inter‐laboratory comparison. Results: The traditional Santrock 17O correction leads to a simulated Δ47 inter‐laboratory comparison offset of 0.06 ‰, and a 0.1 ‰ Δ47 range in CO2‐H2O 23°C equilibrations that is dependent on the 13C composition. The more recent Brand 17O correction removes these discrepancies. The traditional 17O correction yields distinct temperature‐Δ47 calibration curves for synthetic carbonates precipitated using different methods to degas CO2, while the more recent 17O correction collapses all calibration data onto a single curve. Conclusions:The 17O correction strategy employed by CO2 and carbonate clumped‐isotope researchers can have a large effect on the accuracy of Δ47 values. Use of the traditional 17O correction may have caused errors in published studies as large as 0.1 ‰ and may account for Δ47 differences among laboratories and disagreement among previously published carbonate clumped isotope thermometry calibrations.

Studying these high CO2 climates can potentially illuminate what high-CO2 climates will be like in the future. However, a couple of basic questions about these so-called greenhouse climate regimes drive the paleoclimate research.\nA first, seemingly simple, question is: how hot was it really? One way to quantify earth surface temperatures is by using the clumped isotope composition of soil carbonates that formed during that time period. I used a seres of stacked paleosols from Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA to estimate air temperatures in the subtropics (30 °N).\n  Sampling the Hannold Hill Formation in the heat.   My temperature estimates were intriguingly cold - I estimate summer temperatures of 32 °C, which is not that different from modern summer temperatures in the same place. Either I am interpreting the seasonal bias of my proxy incorrectly (see other projects), or the subtropics were surprisingly cool. Publication here.\nAnother aspect of this project is to determine if greenhouse climates were seasonally equable or not. To answer this, I helped my colleague Landon Burgener in his efforts to compare temperature estimates from a myriad of proxies that likely record different seasonal temperatures. We looked at Cretaceous paleosol deposits in Utah and Montana. Publication here.\n  Field work in the Kaiparowits Formation, Utah.
