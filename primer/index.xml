      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term ‘clumped isotopes’ refers to the co-existence of two rare heavy isotopes in a single molecule – or, get ready for a mouthful – a ‘doubly substituted isotopologue’.  We will consider the carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule which is primarily made up of light carbon and oxygen isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) but will also have some of the rare heavy isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) (also &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and others, ignore those for now). Imagine a ballon full of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas with a fixed number of light and heavy isotopes each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a ballon held at 1000 °C, the system is chaotic. Bonds are vibrating and wiggling and nothing really settles down. In this high-temperature system, the heavy and light isotopes end up being randomly distributed amongst the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Image?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a ballon in lower temperatures, the system can reach a more energetically favorable state. Clumping heavy isotopes together is favorable because it slightly reduces the vibrational energy and increases bond strength. So more clumps will occur at lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Image?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, clumped isotope geochemistry is not concerned with the total number of heavy isotopes in a system, but rather how those heavy isotopes are arranged within the molecules. We do need to know the number of heavy isotopes in the system, though, so we can calculate how many clumps we would expect if they were randomly arranged vs. how many we actually have measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chemistry may seem boring but it is useful because it provides the basis of a geothermometer: if we measure the clumpiness of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas evolved from an ancient rock (carbonate mineral) then we can estimate the growth temperature of that mineral. And, with a little bit more work, we can use that to estimate temperatures at or near the surface of the Earth through millions of years. This thermometer is not based on biology nor does it depend on the isotopic composition of the water from which the mineral grew. Put together, that makes for a powerful, quantitative thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
