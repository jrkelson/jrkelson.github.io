      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe most academics don&amp;rsquo;t take long vacations, but I am taking this summer off! The flexibility in postdoc-start-date allowed me to take a break after graduating from UW in June. So, what am I doing with my time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will mostly be in Copenhagen, Denmark, exploring Danish craft beer, swimming in the canals, going for bike rides, and finishing manuscripts from my PhD work. I also plan to travel to Italy, Norway, Czechia, and Sweden. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll head back to North America for a backpacking trip in the Sierra and a sea kayaking trip in British Columbia before driving eastward to my new basecamp in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
