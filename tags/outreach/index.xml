      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have mentored several undergraduate students at the University of Washington. It is helpful to have an army of people when trying to grow synthetic calcite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of watching Nicole graduate with her BS in Earth &amp;amp; Space Sciences - the same day that I walked for my PhD.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently recruiting an undergraduate student to work on Paleocene shells from the East Coast. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone who wants to get their hands on samples - doing drilling and milling, potentially for annual resolution seasonality if the samples cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Presenting geoscience research to K-12 students is a great way to provide science opportunities to underserved communities and demonstrate the possibility for careers in STEM. Plus, it is usually pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In COVID times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been presenting to middle and high school audiences from the comfort of my home. They ask the toughest questions about climate change!&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/outreach/zoom.png&#34; alt=&#34;Some very fun/creative zoom pictures.&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I helped organize field trips for hundreds of students to visit University of Washington&amp;rsquo;s IsoLab throughout several years.  This included a recurring field trip from a high school in South Seattle.






&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through UW Rockin&amp;rsquo; Out, a graduate-student-run volunteer organization, I have also shared my science in elementary school classrooms, participated in science nights, and organized outdoor field trip opportunities for local schools.&lt;/p&gt;
